## How to Play

- **Shift**: In the 'SHIFT' phase, click the arrows around the board to slide the rows or columns. This inserts the "Next Tile" into the board and pushes one out.
- **Rotate**: Press `R` or click the "ROTATE" button to rotate the extra tile before shifting.
- **Move**: After shifting, the phase changes to 'MOVE'. Click on any reachable green-highlighted cell to move your wizard.
- **Win**: Find all the items to win the game!
